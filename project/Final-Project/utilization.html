                    <li>
                        The USP of Python is its language design. It is highly productive, elegant, simple, yet powerful. Python has set the gold standard in terms of developer experience and heavily influenced modern languages like Go, Julia.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python has first-class integration with C/C++ and can seamlessly offload the CPU heavy tasks to C/C++. Also, Python gives powerful toolset for Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Science with various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn. As a result, Python dominates the Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Science landscape and other Scientific domain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Python has a very active community and support. You can always find enough Python libraries and frameworks, no matter whether you are working on Enterprise Applications, Data Science, or Artificial Intelligence.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Thanks to Node.js, JavaScript offers event-driven programming, which is especially suitable for I/O heavy tasks. Today, JavaScript and Node.js run on almost all Platforms, including Servers and Mobile devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript has gone through massive modernization and overhaul in the last several years, especially in 2015, 2016, and later. The major JavaScript releases like ES5, ES6 has added many modern features, and JavaScript of today is entirely different from JavaScript of the last decade.

                    <li>
                        Java is strictly backward compatible, which is a crucial requirement for business applications. Java has never introduced a major breaking change like Python or Scala. As a result, it is still the number one choice for enterprises.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Java’s runtime JVM is a masterpiece of Software Engineering and one of the best virtual machines in the industry. With 25 years of innovation and engineering craftsmanship, JVM offers high performance and features to Java. Also, JVM provides some advanced Garbage Collection to Java.

                        Anders Hejlsberg did an excellent job to bring C# out of Java’s shadow and give its own identity. In terms of developer experience, C# is ahead of Java.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Backed by Microsoft and being in the industry for 20 years, C# has large ecosystems of libraries and frameworks. The ASP.NET is used for Web Development, especially on Windows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Like Java, C# is also platform independent (thanks to CLR) and runs on Windows, Linux, Mobile devices.
